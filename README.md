# Suicide-Detection-using-Natural-Language-Processing
Early detection of suicidal ideation in depressed individuals can allow for adequate medical attention and support, which can be life-saving. Recent NLP research focuses on classifying, from the given text, if an individual is suicidal or clinically healthy. However, there have been no major attempts to differentiate between depression and suicidal ideation, which is a separate and important clinical challenge. Due to the scarce availability of EHR data, suicide notes, or other verified sources, web query data has emerged as a promising alternative. Online sources, such as Reddit, allow for anonymity, prompting honest disclosure of symptoms, making it a plausible source even in a clinical setting. However, online datasets also result in inherent noise in webscraped labels, which necessitates a noise-removal process to improve performance. Recent literature mainly focuses on the use of Deep Learning models for classification, which is why we propose a transformer-based classifier to classify suicide vs depression ideation. Our extensive experimentation with transformer-based classifiers displays their strong performance of it as a new clinical application for a challenging problem
